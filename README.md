# 🇯🇵 Japan National Workforce Atlas

## 📊 Project Overview
This comprehensive 3-page project compares census data for Japan to visualize the Labour Landscape, Wealth Map, and Workforce Dynamics.

## 🔍 Page 1: The Labour Landscape
* **Employment Status:** Regular staff make up **60.79%** of the workforce, followed by Irregular staff (31.01%) and Self-Employed (8.2%).
* **The Tokyo Magnet:** **7.6 Million** people work in Tokyo—a workforce larger than all other prefectures combined.
* **Top Profession:** Clerical work leads the nation with **14.5 Million** people.
* **Visuals:** Includes a bubble map where size indicates workforce density, allowing users to zoom into major economic hubs like Tokyo.

## 🔍 Page 2: The Wealth Map
* **Economic Groups:** Calculated as Low Income (<3M), Lower Middle (3-6M), Upper Middle (6-10M), High Income (10-15M), and Top Tier (>15M).
* **Key Findings:**
    * **48%** of Japan's workforce are Low-Income earners (<3M Yen).
    * **37%** of Top-Tier earners (>15M) are concentrated in **Professional & Engineering**.
* **The Outlier:** The scatter plot (Avg Income vs Workforce Size) shows **Tokyo** as an astronomical outlier with ~7M workforce and just under ~5M Avg Income, while most prefectures cluster between 0-1M workforce and 3-3.5M income.
* **Status vs Income:** Analysis shows most Irregular staff and Self-Employed workers fall into the Low-Income bracket, while Regular staff span across Lower-Middle to Upper-Middle.

## 🔍 Page 3: Workforce Dynamics
* **Gender Segregation:**
    * **Women:** Make up **60%** of Admin roles but only **15%** of Admin Management.
    * **Men:** Dominate Construction and Transport, making up **95%** of those sectors.
* **Employment Status:** Women are split evenly between Regular and Irregular employment. Men are mostly Regular staff, with only ~20% Irregular and ~10% Self-Employed (double the rate of women).
* **Income Disparity:** Women have nearly twice as many Low-Income earners as men. Men dominate the Upper-Middle, High, and Top Tier income brackets.
* **Demographics:** The total workforce is **54.12% Male** and **45.88% Female**.
